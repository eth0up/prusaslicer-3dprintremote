<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

While browsing 3d model sites I often wished that I could somehow slice and send to printer directly from my smartphone. When I learned about the ability to use PrusaSlicer from the console, I started thinking about what I'd need to make my wish become reality.

For the first pass, I had these features in mind:
* Download an STL from a provided URL - I'd need some sort of server running on my designated slicing machine in order to handle URL get requests.
* Provide the downloaded STL to the console slicer (configured with my desired slicing profile) and keep note of the resultant gcode file.
* Send the gcode file to Octoprint instance and invoke the print. All as automated as possible, of course! :smile:

I came up with this project to serve my immediate wish. No single approach/workflow is the "right way" and your needs may be different. I'll be adding additional functionality in the future and I welcome your suggestions. Feel free to suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. 

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

### Prerequisites

You'll need the following things in place before you can start using this project:
* Python 3 (I am using Python 3.8) with pip installed
    - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6587507/how-to-install-pip-with-python-3
* An instance of PrusaSlicer that has at least one profile configured
* prusa-slicer-console.exe and PrusaSlicer.dll
    - If you don't see prusa-slicer-console.exe within the same directory as PrusaSlicer.exe, update your PrusaSlicer installation. At minimum, this project will need to have read access to a directory containing both prusa-slicer-console.exe and PrusaSlicer.dll.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```git clone https://github.com/eth0up/prusaslicer-3dprintremote.git```
2. In PrusaSlicer, export the profiles you would like to use 
   ```PrusaSlicer -> File -> Export -> Export Config```
   - Ensure you have exported as *.ini file(s)
3. Place exported ini files in the PROFILES folder of your local repo
4. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory of your local repo
5. Install the Python modules via pip:
```python -m pip install -r requirements.txt```
 - NOTE: As of this publish, the current OctoRest release (v0.4) does NOT contain my start-print-flag fix. Ensure you are installing the version of octorest found in requirements.txt. If manually installing modules as opposed to doing so via the above command, you can run the following to get an octorest build containing my fix: ```python -m pip install https://github.com/eth0up/OctoRest/archive/eth0up-start-print-fix.zip```
6. Edit 3dprintremote.py ```# Global Variables``` section to match your environment
7. Start the server from a terminal: ```python 3dprintremote.py```
8. Using a web browser, navigate to the host:port that you configured in 3dprintremote.py global variables section
